        c_intro : "The pace of development in quantum computing mirrors the rapid advances made in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is natural to ask whether quantum technologies could boost learning algorithms: this field of inquiry is called quantum-enhanced machine learning. This course aims to show what benefits current and future quantum technologies can provide to machine learning, focusing on algorithms that are challenging with classical digital computers. We strongly emphasize implementing the protocols using open-source frameworks in Qiskit on Real Quantum Computers. ",
